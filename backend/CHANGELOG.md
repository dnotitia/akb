# AKB Backend — Changelog

The AKB backend ships as a Docker image and as the HTTP layer behind
the `akb-mcp` stdio proxy. This changelog tracks the backend
specifically; the proxy has its own log in
`packages/akb-mcp-client/CHANGELOG.md` and a separate version stream.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-05-21

First public minor release. The headline is the **security model
switch**: vault isolation in `akb_sql` is now enforced by
PostgreSQL ACL, not by application-side identifier filters. The
boundary lives in the platform's trusted base, not in a regex the
maintainer has to keep cat-and-mouse with new PG catalog names.

This is an additive change. Existing deployments upgrade in place;
no data migration, no breaking contract changes.

### Highlights

- **PG-native vault isolation for `akb_sql`.** Each user gets an
  `akb_user_<uid>` PG role, each vault gets three group roles
  (`akb_vault_<vid>_{reader,writer,admin}`), and `vault_access` rows
  map 1:1 to role memberships. The akb_sql executor opens a tx,
  `SET LOCAL ROLE` to the caller's role, and runs the query. PG
  returns `42501` directly for any cross-vault reference — the
  application no longer inspects user SQL for forbidden identifiers.
  Public vaults reach all authenticated users via a wildcard
  `akb_authenticated` role. Design in
  `docs/designs/pg-native-rbac/`.

- **ACL hardening at the MCP boundary.** `akb_search` now forwards
  the caller's `user_id` into the service layer so the ACL prefilter
  actually fires, and falls closed with `check_vault_access` when a
  vault arg is supplied (#66, #67). `SearchService.search` itself
  now raises `ValidationError` if both `vault` and `user_id` are
  None — mirroring the existing guard in `grep` (#70, #71).

- **Concurrency & atomicity audit follow-through.** Eight weeks of
  audit (`docs/reviews/2026-05-20-concurrency-audit/`) landed as
  hardening across the write path: deterministic lock order in
  `bm25_vocab` UPSERT, race-safe `pgvector.ensure_collection`,
  serialized GitPython IndexFile ops, vault-level advisory locking
  on put/update/edit/delete.

- **Server-side JWT revocation.** `users.tokens_revoked_before` is
  checked on every request so admin / user / self-initiated session
  invalidation reflects immediately, without rotating the global
  `jwt_secret`.

### Operational endpoints (admin-only)

- `GET  /api/v1/admin/role-state` — read-only diff of PG role state
  vs catalog (drift inspection). Returns missing/orphan user roles,
  missing memberships, missing or stale public-access grants, and
  per-table GRANT drift in one call.
- `POST /api/v1/admin/reconcile-roles` — on-demand reconciler if
  diff reveals drift. Same idempotent pass that runs at startup.
- `GET  /api/v1/admin/users` — list every user with stats.
- `DELETE /api/v1/admin/users/{user_id}` — admin-driven user
  deletion (owned vaults cascade).
- `POST /api/v1/admin/users/{user_id}/revoke-sessions` — invalidate
  every JWT for a user (incident response / offboarding).
- `POST /api/v1/admin/users/{user_id}/reset-password` — generate a
  one-time temporary password.

### Observability

- `/health.rbac` — `RoleSync` hook-failure counters + last reconcile
  outcome + timestamp. Surfaces silent drift to dashboards without
  log grep.
- `lifecycle.start_workers` now joins a periodic `RoleSync`
  reconcile loop (configurable via
  `role_sync_reconcile_interval_secs`, default 3600 s, 0 to
  disable).

### Versioned reads

- `akb_get` / REST `GET /documents/{id}?version=<commit>` —
  retrieve any historical commit of a document. Frontmatter is
  parsed against the version's metadata when possible, with a
  `metadata_is_current` flag when the version predates a
  frontmatter shape change. Git is canonical for body; PG metadata
  is best-effort for older commits.

### Search & indexing

- Parallel `embed_worker` via `indexing_concurrency` config — N
  workers drain the chunks queue in parallel, with per-row
  transactions so a crash doesn't double-index.
- BM25 corpus stats (`avgdl`, per-term `df`) refreshed on a cadence
  (`bm25_recompute_interval_secs`, default 6 h) so the sparse leg
  doesn't stay degenerate after fresh installs.
- Rerank fusion scoring (Reciprocal Rank Fusion) improved to
  preserve first-stage signal when rerank reorders.
- LongMemEval hybrid retrieval tuning — see
  `eval/longmemeval/results/2026-05-20-longmemeval-s.md`.
- Embed worker always sends the configured `embed_dimensions`
  param so MRL models match the schema dim.

### Skill-flow polish

- `akb_help(topic="vault-skill", vault=<name>)` returns the vault's
  skill doc + a default fallback when the vault hasn't customised
  it. `text/markdown` content-type for direct rendering.
- New `GET /api/v1/help/skill-template` exposes the default
  vault-skill body for previewing in the UI before vault creation.
- Vault create seeds `overview/vault-skill.md` with a "Guide" title
  + 6-relation enum + Document Template section.

### Internal / removed

- The application-side `akb_sql` sandbox (`_validate_sql_surface`
  identifier blocklist, `_FORBIDDEN_TOKEN` regex, `_VT_IDENTIFIER`
  match, `allowed_pg_tables` enumeration, read-only-tx forcing) is
  removed. The boundary moved to PG; these become redundant.
- `POST /api/v1/auth/tokens` no longer accepts a `scopes` array.
  The DB column stays, but the input was a user-visible lie — no
  request handler ever enforced it. Re-introduce with the matching
  check when scope enforcement is wired in.

### MCP tool surface

No tool was removed. Tools whose internal flow changed:

- `akb_sql` — runs via PG-RBAC executor; cross-vault references
  return PG `42501`; admin users bypass the per-user role and run
  as the backend service role (matching existing trust model).
- `akb_search` — forwards `user_id`; fails closed on
  unauthorized-vault arg.
- `akb_set_public` — moved out of the MCP handler into
  `access_service.set_public_access`; the handler is now a thin
  adapter. Same semantics, cleaner separation.

### Test plan

- 50 cases in the new `test_pg_rbac_e2e.sh` covering positive
  paths, 15 cross-vault SQL surface variations, app pre-flight
  reject, reader scope, public-vault access, and lifecycle drift
  recovery.
- 14 unit cases in `test_role_sync.py` covering helpers, lifecycle
  hook idempotency, public-access transitions, drift detection
  including per-table GRANT drift, hook metrics.
- New `scripts/bench_pg_rbac.py` microbenchmark. Measured locally:
  `SET LOCAL ROLE` adds ~63 µs per `akb_sql` tx; reconcile of
  50 users × 25 vaults + 251 grants finishes in 108 ms.
- All 8 existing e2e suites pass unchanged (`test_mcp_e2e` 75/75,
  `test_security_edge` 65/65 after #69, etc.).

### Acknowledgments

- **@MackDing** for #65 (proxy keep-alive perf) and #66/#67 (MCP
  search ACL enforcement) — first external contributor; the
  security PR pushed maintainer audit into the surrounding handlers
  and surfaced #70 / #71 follow-ups.

## 0.1.0
